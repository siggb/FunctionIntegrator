![Second Page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/siggb/FunctionIntegrator/master/IntagratingMachine/Resources/screenshots/IMG_01.png "Second Page")

This project were created for the educational purposes of the course "Specialized Computers" ([Vladimir State University](http://vlsu.ru), specialty ID is 230101).

It is a function integrator for iOS with the variable accuracy. Requires XCode 4.5 and iOS 6 iPad. Project runs on the device or simulator.

### Requirements

* Xcode 4.5 or higher
* Apple LLVM compiler
* iOS 6.0 or higher
* ARC

### Main Idea

For a given function ![Origin Func](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/siggb/FunctionIntegrator/master/IntagratingMachine/Resources/screenshots/IMG_03.png "Origin Func") make SES (System of Equations [Shannon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon)) in symmetrical form and write a block diagram of a parallel DIS ([Digital Integration System](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrator)) simulating its work process.

Perform calculations estimated parameters of DIS:
* integration step
* bit variables and increments for numerical integration formulas rectangles (m = 0) and trapezoids (m = 1) for the requirements of computing functions
* produce comparative performance evaluation for parallel DIS symmetric and asymmetric forms of SES.
